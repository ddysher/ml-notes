# MKL-DNN

Intel(R) Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel(R) MKL-DNN) is an open-source
performance library for deep learning applications. The library includes basic building blocks for
neural networks optimized for Intel Architecture Processors and Intel Processor Graphics. Intel
MKL-DNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework developers intersted in improving
application performance on Intel CPUs and GPUs.

MLK-DNN is used in deep learning frameworks to implement CPU kernels.
