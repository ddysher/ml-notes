# Dlib

[Dlib](http://dlib.net) is a general purpose cross-platform open source software library written in
the C++ programming language. It aims to be a general software library, but now mostly becomes a
toolkit for making real world machine learning and data analysis applications in C++. As mentioned
in its introduction:

> In particular, it now contains software components for dealing with networking, threads, graphical
> interfaces, complex data structures, linear algebra, statistical machine learning, image processing,
> data mining, XML and text parsing, numerical optimization, Bayesian networks, and numerous other
> tasks. In recent years, much of the development has been focused on creating a broad set of statistical
> machine learning tools. However, dlib remains a general purpose library and welcomes contributions of
> high quality software components useful in any domain.

To experiment with python API, just `pip install dlib` and run `python_examples`.
