# LightGBM

[LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient
boosting (GBDT, GBRT, GBM or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking,
classification and many other machine learning tasks.

LightGBM improves on XGBoost. The LightGBM paper uses XGBoost as a baseline and outperforms it in
training speed and the dataset sizes it can handle. The accuracies are comparable.
