## cuDNN

cuDNN stands for CUDA Deep Neural Network, it is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep
neural networks. cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as forward
and backward convolution, pooling, normalization, and activation layers.

Deep learning frameworks, including Caffe, Caffe2, Chainer, Keras, MATLAB, MxNet, TensorFlow, and
PyTorch, use cuDNN to implement GPU-enabled kernels.

Here is the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0759) of cuDNN.
