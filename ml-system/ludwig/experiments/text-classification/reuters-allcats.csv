Neg-,2 OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS     BY TED DAFFLISIO  Reuters     NEW YORK  Feb 26 - OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices  oil industry analysts said     The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems  said Daniel Yergin  director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets     OPECs problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way  said Paul Mlotok  oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc     He said the markets earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 158 mln bpd quota set last December     OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas  fixed prices and set differentials  said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again  he added     David T Mizrahi  editor of Mideast reports  expects OPEC to meet before June  although not immediately However  he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems     They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil  but in late March and April when demand slackens  Mizrahi said     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 158 mln bpd     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPECs ability to hold together prices and output     OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then  said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard Universitys Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production     Demand for their OPEC oil is clearly above 158 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production  he told Reuters in a telephone interview  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE     by Maggie McNeil  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 3 - Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter  weather and crop analysts said     Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point  but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems  analysts said     But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans  analysts of the Soviet Union said     From a weather standpoint  you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop than last year  Gail Martell  chief meteorologist for EF Hutton said     The next six weeks in the USSRs grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops  Martell and other analysts said     Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us  an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said     The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years  the USDA analyst said     With a timely spring  Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops  but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower     Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures This winter  however  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent  so the bulk of winterkill  analysts speculate  likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination     Fall dryness may be a problem Theres a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness  Martell said     Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine  and below normal over the entire winter crop area  she said     Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill  Jim Candor  senior forecaster for Accu Weather  said     Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter  analysts said The dry fall damaged pastures  the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding  they said     The Soviets are not in a desperate situation  they dont have to buy grains now  a USDA official said     But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last years huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions  more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies  he said     Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market  weather analysts said     A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half  Martell said  Reuter 3

Pos-coffee,2 COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS     By Douglas Learmond  Reuters     LONDON  March 3 - Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas  ICO delegates and traders said     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization  ICO  producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-12 year low at one stage of 1 270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1 314 stg  down 184 stg from the previous close     The New York May price was down 1559 at 10800 cents a lb     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices  some senior traders said     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 11466 cents a lb for March 2 This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop     In a Reuter interview  Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions If we have failed at the ICO  at least we have tried  Dauster said  adding now it is time to go and sell coffee     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month  Dauster said It is too difficult to forecast now Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 112 mln Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market last year     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares  Dauster said     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings     It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share-outs of quota  Dauster said     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them     We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage  one delegate said     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine In that case quotas could come into force during the summer But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely  while Brazils Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found     Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now  one consumer said  Reuter 3
