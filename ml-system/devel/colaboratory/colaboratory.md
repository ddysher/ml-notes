## Colaboratory

A hosted Jupyter environment tool/service from Google. Users can work with Jupyter notebook just as
they would with Google doc. The notebooks are saved in Google Drive.

Code is running in virtual machines dedicated to a user. The environment is suitable for interactive
use cases: long running jobs may be stopped if used inappropriately.
