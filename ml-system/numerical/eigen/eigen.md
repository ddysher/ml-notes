# Eigen

Eigen is a high-level C++ library of template headers for linear algebra, matrix and vector
operations, geometrical transformations, numerical solvers and related algorithms.

Eigen doesn't have any dependencies other than the C++ standard library, but it can be linked to
libraries like MKL for speed up if needed (by defining `EIGEN_USE_MKL_ALL`).
