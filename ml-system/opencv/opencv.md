# Overview

[OpenCV](http://opencv.org) is an open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds of
computer vision algorithms. OpenCV has a modular structure, which means that the package includes
several shared or static libraries. As of v4.0.0 (11/2018), the main modules are:
- core. Core functionality (e.g. array operation, hardware acceleration, etc)
- imgproc. Image Processing
- imgcodecs. Image file reading and writing
- videoio. Video I/O
- highgui. High-level GUI
- video. Video Analysis
- calib3d. Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction
- features2d. 2D Features Framework
- objdetect. Object Detection
- dnn. Deep Neural Network module (e.g. load models from tensorflow/caffe2/etc)
- ml. Machine Learning (e.g. algorithms like knn/svm/etc)
- flann. Clustering and Search in Multi-Dimensional Spaces
- photo. Computational Photography
- stitching. Images stitching
- gapi. Graph API

There are also a lot of extra modules, see openc docs:: https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/
