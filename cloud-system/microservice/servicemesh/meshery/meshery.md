# Overview

[Meshery](https://layer5.io/meshery/) is a community-driven project to compare, experiment and
benchmark different service meshes. It includes adapters for istio, linkerd, consul, kuma, maesh,
etc.

Meshery includes a simple control plane and dashboard to quickly install a service mesh and perform
performance test. Meshery has a [benchmark specification]( https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-benchmark-spec)
to guide the test.
