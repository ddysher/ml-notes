   Quote: "The biggest concern I have is that we be very very sure that a volume
   that has been accessed as block can NEVER be used as mounted, without having
   been thoroughly scrubbed."  For example, the block device is first being used
   as block device; then as a hacker, I write a filesystem that conforms to ext4
   filesystem. Then later, the block device is asked to be mounted as ext4 fs,
   and since the block device contains hacker's fake ext4, it can write things
   to crash the kernel.
