* Design: operatorkit (07/28/2017, k8s 1.7)
  Operator aims to unify the effort for implementing operators. Scopes of the
  project includes:
    - setup, configuration, and validation of a CLI framework
    - common logging handlers
    - setup of common clients such as for CRD APIs, kube-apiserver API, leader election and analytics
    - code for easy leadership election management
    - easy management of k8s resources, such as reconciliation loops for CRDs and utility function to set up common cluster resources possibly at a later stage
    - boilerplate code for registering, validating and configuring CRD specs
    - resource monitoring, providing utilities to handle channels, decoding, caching and error handling
    - enforce and supply best practices for disaster recovery, e.g. if the operator is on a rebooting node
    - allow easy exposure of APIs if the operator wants to export data
