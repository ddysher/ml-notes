# Overview

Fuel is an open-source tool that enables you to easily and quickly provision multiple OpenStack
environments, as well as manage your environments after deployment.

Fuel provides a web user interface (WUI), as well as a command-line user interface (CLI) and RESTful
API for provisioning, configuration, and management of OpenStack environments. A link to the Horizon
OpenStack Dashboard appears in the Fuel web UI after you deploy an OpenStack environment.
