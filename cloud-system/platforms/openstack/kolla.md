# Overview

*Date: 03/18/2017*

Kolla provides Docker containers and Ansible playbooks to meet Kollaâ€™s mission.

Kolla's mission is to provide production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating OpenStack
clouds. Simply put, kolla enables deploying containerized openstack. [kolla](https://github.com/openstack/kolla)
builds images which are used by [kolla-ansible](https://github.com/openstack/kolla-ansible) to deploy
OpenStack. The [kolla-kubernetes](https://github.com/openstack/kolla-kubernetes) deliverable deploys
OpenStack on top of Kubernetes, using helm.

*Update on 10/07/2019*

kolla-kubernetes is retired and moved to https://github.com/openstack/openstack-helm.
