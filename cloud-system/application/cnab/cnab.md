# Overview

[Cloud Native Application Bundles (CNAB)](https://cnab.io/) are a package format specification that
describes a technology for bundling, installing, and managing distributed applications, that are by
design, cloud agnostic. The project is initiated from Docker and Microsoft.

There is an [ongoing effort](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-to-oci) to convert cnab package into oci
distribution, as stated in the document:

> There is a clear trend towards more types of artifacts being stored in container registries. While
> it's too early to predict exactly what will be stored in registries, a couple of observations can
> be made.
