# Overview

IronFunctions is a serverless microservices platform by https://iron.io.

The core team working on serverless platform from iron.io joined Oracle to build fnproject, and the
concepts and architecture in ironfunctions and fnproject are quite similar. ironfunctions are not
actively maintained, thus it can be seen as superceded by fnproject.
