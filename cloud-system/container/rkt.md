# Overview

*Date: 03/11/2018, v1.29*

rkt is a pod-native container engine for Linux. It is composable, secure, and built on standards.
rkt does not have full OCI native support. Following OCI evolution and stabilization, it will
become the preferred way over appc. However, rkt will continue to support the ACI image format
and distribution mechanism. With the donation to CNCF, rkt repository is moved from:
https://github.com/coreos/rkt to https://github.com/rkt/rkt
