## Tensorflow Estimators

The general outline of premade_estimator.py -- and many other TensorFlow programs -- is as follows:

- Import and parse the data sets
- Create feature columns to describe the data.
- Select the type of model
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model's effectiveness
- Let the trained model make predictions
